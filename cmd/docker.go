// dockerCmd represents the docker command
var dockerCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "docker",
	Short: "A command to create a skeleton Dockerfile",
	Long: `A command that created a skeleton Dockerfile for you to start work with.
This is similar to the --docker flag with the init command, but you need to pass the app name here. For example:

kgmod docker --app-name kgmod-svc`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		appName, _ := cmd.Flags().GetString("app-name")
		utils.CreateDockerfile(appName)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(dockerCmd)
	dockerCmd.Flags().StringP("app-name", "a", "", "Provide the application name")
	dockerCmd.MarkFlagRequired("app-name")
}
